Hi, I am just a fox trying to make games for fun. I currently use Godot, since I am quite fond of open source softwares and pretty familiar with its Python like syntax. 
I'm also learning Blender to make 3D models/assets, quite used to Inkscape, less with Gimp, but I am trying to use it more often. My repos are projects developed for gamejams on Itch where you can test them.
